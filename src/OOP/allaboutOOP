Object Oriented Programming Features
       Abstraction
       Encapsulation
       Inheritance
       Polymorphism


 1. Inheritance (Parent and child class) ----> keyword = extend
 2. Encapsulation = Hide the data
 3. Abstraction = keep the comman values in one class.
 4. Polymorphism: you can create multiple implementation of single values


Test.

1.demo class (main)
1. Animal class
  - int age;
  -int runspeed
  -string name

  -- Method
  --move ( void)

  --child class. 1. cat 2. dog
  reuse the method and variable from supper class..


  3. Abstraction
   - An abstract class has no use until unless it is extended by some other class.
   - If you declare an abstract method in a class then you must declare the
         class abstract as well. you can’t have abstract method in a concrete class.
         It’s vice versa is not always true: If a class is not having any abstract method
         then also it can be marked as abstract.
   - It can have non-abstract method (concrete) as well.

   some basics and example of abstract method.
   1) Abstract method has no body.
   2) Always end the declaration with a semicolon(;).
   3) It must be overridden. An abstract class must be extended and in a
      same way abstract method must be overridden.
   4) A class has to be declared abstract to have abstract methods.
