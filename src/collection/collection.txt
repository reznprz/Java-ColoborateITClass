Collection Framework

1. List Interface (Allowed dupicate elements and one null value).
    1.1 Arraylist (when we add the element -- will not preserve the insetion order)
    1.2 Linklist   (Will store insertion order).
    1.3 Vector  (Thread safe).
2. Set Interface (doesn't allowed duplicates or null value).
    2.1 Hashset
    2.1 LinkedHashset
    2.3 treeSet  (Ascending order)
3. Queue Interface
    3.1 PriorityQueue


    -All collection class doesnot allow primitive data type.
    -we must user wrapper class.
    int = Integer
    long = Long
    boolean = Boolean

    - its resizable array so it can hold elements as we are ending. doesn't have limit.

    Syntax:
    Name of Interface or Class Name
    <> with data types
    = new ANd class name.

    //E.g
    List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
    this is the varibale called list = it can hold String data(any amount).
